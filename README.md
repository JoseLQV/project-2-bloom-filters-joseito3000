project-2-bloom-filters-joseito3000 created by GitHub Classroom   (fork from my university account to my personal account)

This is a Java, Data Structures course project:
A Bloom Filter Algorithms is a Data Structure that uses Hashing to give a certain input a specific integer code.
This Algorithm eliminates False Positives 

I was given .csv inputFiles and a .java file that has interface that contained 6 main methods for the course project.
The first thing that I had to do was to focus on the method named "createDatabase","createCheck" that implemented 
BufferReader to extract the information from the Input Files and store it in ArrayLists, SinglyLinkedList.

The next 3 main methods where 'bloomFilter","hashing" and "fillingBloomFilter", 
this methods are incharged of the Bloom Filter Algorithm ,where I had to implement formulas and auxiliar-methods.

After the BloomFilter Algorithm methods I had to generate the Bloom Filter Results where I had to learned how to use a
BufferWriter to send the information to a Result.csv
